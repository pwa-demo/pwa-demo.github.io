# Permissioner

## Introduction
This tool is designed to measure the PWA (Progressive Web Application) permission systems. Further details are available in our paper.

## Steps to Run the Tool

1. **Prepare the Environment**  
   Visit [https://pwa-demo.github.io/prepare](https://pwa-demo.github.io/prepare). Here, you can download browsers for your mobile devices. If you are interested in downloading previous versions of a browser, a search function is also provided.

2. **Permission Decision Evaluation and Browser Compatibility Analysis**  
   To measure Permission Decision Evaluation and Browser Compatibility Analysis as discussed in our paper, visit [https://pwa-demo.github.io/default](https://pwa-demo.github.io/default).  
   To assess Cross-Browser Permission Variability Analysis, go to [https://pwa-demo.github.io/plus](https://pwa-demo.github.io/plus).

3. **Pre-install Actions and Post-install Tests**  
   Pre-install actions and post-install tests are detailed in our paper. Alternatively, you can contact the author of this repository for more information. Due to the extensive manual effort required, we do not offer a demo for these tests unless there is significant interest.

4. **PWA and Browser Cleanup**  
   For cleaning up PWAs and browsers on your mobile devices, visit [https://pwa-demo.github.io/cleanup](https://pwa-demo.github.io/cleanup).
